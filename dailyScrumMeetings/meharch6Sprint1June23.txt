What did I work on in the last three days?
	- Created and cleaned up the code for both the File and Error classes

What do I plan to work on in the next three days?
	- Creating and refining the code for the Cat, Echo and Man commands

Am I blocked on anything?
	- I need the FileSystem class to be fully implemented before Cat and Echo can be completed.
