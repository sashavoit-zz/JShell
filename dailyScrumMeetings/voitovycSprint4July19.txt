What did I work on in the last three days?
    - worked on my personal tasks for sprint 4:
        - added toString method for the FileSystem class
        - added ability of mkdir to work with multiple arugments
        - added ability of ls to list contents recursively
        - added ability of ls to redirect output to a file
    - brainstormed ideas for new design with my teammates
    - updated CRC cards to reflect new design

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - add unit tests for mkdir and ls commands
    - add redirection of output for tree command and add unit tests for the redirection of tree command
    

Am I blocked on anything?
    - waiting for tree command to be implemented
