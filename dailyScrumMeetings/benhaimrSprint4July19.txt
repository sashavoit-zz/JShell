What did I work on in the last three days?
	- Brainstormmed new design with my team
	- Updated and check some CRC cards
	- Worked on the cp and mv commands

What do I plan to work on in the next three days?
	- Test the mv and cp commands
	- Finish and test the find command

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Should the find command search for files recursively?
