What did I work on in the last three days?
	- Created and began basic testing on the Cat and Echo commands
	- Created and finished coding and testing the Man commadn

What do I plan to work on in the next three days?
	- Finalizing the code and finishing thorough testing for the Cat and Echo commands
	- Updating Error messages across all code to clarify each specific instance of an error occurring

Am I blocked on anything?
	- There are some issues within the FileSystem and Directory classes related to constructing these objects that are preventing complete testing from taking place.
