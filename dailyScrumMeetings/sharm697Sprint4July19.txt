What did I work on in the last three days?
	- Added Redirection for Pwd, History commands
	- Added first implementation of Rm and Tree commands
	
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- Fixing bugs for Rm and Tree commands
	- Adding unit testing for old commands (Pwd,History,Cd) commands and for
	new commands (Rm and tree)
	

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Figuring how to unit test for Pwd,History,Cd,Tree,Rm commands 
    since they return void.
